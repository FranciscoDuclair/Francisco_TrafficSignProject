The project is a good one but i faced alot of difficulties in installing Tensoflow and Opencv "cv2" then could not save my model "best_model.h5". I tried to install it to another drive but i still face alot of difficulties.
     Apart from that every thing concerning the code went well.

       To conclude i notice that the images were not that clear then were not facilitating my vision to analyse which traffic sign is it representating for the categories classifications.
