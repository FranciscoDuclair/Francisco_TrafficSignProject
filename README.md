The project is a good one but i faced alot of difficulties in installing Tensoflow and Opencv "cv2" which made it difficult to trained  my model "best_model.h5". I tried to install it to another drive but i still face alot of difficulties.
Apart from that every thing concerning the code went well.

The project aimed was to develop a traffic sign recognition system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow. This project went through several stages and difficulties that is data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

 Again, i notice that the images were not that clear then were not facilitating my vision to analyse which traffic sign is it representating for the categories classificationsm although i gathered a dataset of traffic signs images from various sources which correspond to the categories in the gtsrb dataset. 
 
 To conclude, I think tried my best after several problems faced, thank you for reading.
